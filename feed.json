            "summary": "It is conceivable that developers constantly update their Cadence workflow code based upon new business use cases and needs. However,\nthe definition of a Cadence workflow must be deterministic because behind the scenes cadence uses event sourcing to construct\nthe workflow state by replaying the historical events stored for this specific workflow. Introducing components that are not compatible\nwith an existing running workflow will yield to non-deterministic errors and sometimes developers find it tricky to debug. Consider the\nfollowing workflow that executes two activities.\n\nfunc SampleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, data string) (string, error) {\n    ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{\n        ScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Minute,\n        StartToCloseTimeout:    time.Minute,\n    }\n    ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)\n    var result1 string\n    err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", err\n    }\n    v ...",

As diverse teams often encounter distinct business use cases, it becomes imperative to address the most frequently reported issues in Cadence workflows. To provide valuable insights and guidance, the Cadence team has meticulously compiled these common challenges based on customer feedback.\n\nReusing the same workflow ID for very active/continuous running workflows\n\nCadence organizes workflows based on their unique IDs, using a process called partitioning. If a workflow receives a large number of updates in a short period of time or frequently starts new runs using the continueAsNew function, all these updates will be directed to the same shard. Unfortunately, the Cadence backend is not equipped to handle this concentrated workload efficiently. As a result, a situation known as a \"hot shard\" arises, overloading the Cadence backend and worsening the prob ...",

Among these, the worker service is the most crucial focus for developers as it hosts the activities and workflows of a Cadence application. In this blog, I will provide a short tutorial on how to implement a simple worker service from scratch in Go.\n\nTo finish this tutorial, there are two prerequisites you need to finish first\nRegister a Cadence domain for your worker. For this tutorial, I've already registered a domain named test-domain\nStart the Cadence backend server in background.\n\nTo get started, let's simply use the native HTTP package built in Go to start a process listening to port 3000. You may customize the port for your worker, but the port you choose should not conflict with existing port for your Cadence backend.\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc main( ...",
